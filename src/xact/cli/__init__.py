Package of functions implementing the xact command line interface.

The xact command line interface is implemented with
the help of the python click library.

    https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/

This cli module provides a thin wrapper around
the click library. It also provides a custom
command group that displays help text for the
commands in the same order that they were defined
in the source code.
